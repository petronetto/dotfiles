# Design and code-quality standards

These apply to both planning and implementation, and to review. The goal is a design so simple and direct it feels inevitable.

**Be ambitious about structural simplification.** Reframe the problem so whole branches, helpers, modes, conditionals, or layers disappear. Prefer deleting complexity over rearranging it. For every proposed step, ask: is there a "code judo" move that makes this dramatically simpler?

**Keep files small and cohesive.** Treat a file past ~1,000 lines as a design smell. Extract helpers or focused modules rather than letting it sprawl; when a step would push a file past that, plan a decomposition step first.

**Avoid spaghetti branching.** Push logic into a dedicated abstraction, helper, state machine, or module rather than scattering ad-hoc conditionals or special cases into unrelated flows.

**Program to interfaces and boundaries.** Keep logic in its canonical layer; avoid feature-specific logic leaking into general-purpose modules. Prefer explicit typed models and shared contracts over loosely-shaped ad-hoc objects. Make invariants explicit instead of papering over them with silent fallbacks.

**Prefer direct, boring, maintainable code.** Treat brittle or "magic" behavior as a design problem. Be skeptical of thin abstractions and pass-through helpers that add indirection without clarity. Prefer existing canonical utilities over bespoke one-offs.

**Clean the design, not just the behavior.** If behavior can stay the same while structure becomes meaningfully cleaner, choose the cleaner version. Prefer removing moving pieces over spreading the same complexity around.

**The best comment is not a comment at all.** Write clear, concise code instead of verbose comments that obscure intent.

**Test behavior, not implementation.** Use the AAA pattern and mock external dependencies. Run linters and tests where available, piping long output.

## Codebase Design

Design **deep modules**: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface, placed at a clean seam, testable through that interface. Use this language and these principles wherever code is being designed or restructured. The aim is leverage for callers, locality for maintainers, and testability for everyone.

### Deep vs shallow

**Deep module** = small interface + lots of implementation:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Small Interface   │  ← Few methods, simple params
├─────────────────────┤
│                     │
│  Deep Implementation│  ← Complex logic hidden
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Shallow module** = large interface + little implementation (avoid):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│       Large Interface           │  ← Many methods, complex params
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Thin Implementation            │  ← Just passes through
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

When designing an interface, ask:

- Can I reduce the number of methods?
- Can I simplify the parameters?
- Can I hide more complexity inside?

### Principles

- **Depth is a property of the interface, not the implementation.** A deep module can be internally composed of small, mockable, swappable parts; they just aren't part of the interface. A module can have **internal seams** (private to its implementation, used by its own tests) as well as the **external seam** at its interface.
- **The deletion test.** Imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, it was a pass-through. If complexity reappears across N callers, it was earning its keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.** Callers and tests cross the same seam. If you want to test *past* the interface, the module is probably the wrong shape.
- **One adapter means a hypothetical seam. Two adapters means a real one.** Don't introduce a seam unless something actually varies across it.

### Designing for testability

Good interfaces make testing natural:

1. **Accept dependencies, don't create them.**

   ```typescript
   // Testable
   function processOrder(order, paymentGateway) {}

   // Hard to test
   function processOrder(order) {
     const gateway = new StripeGateway();
   }
   ```

2. **Return results, don't produce side effects.**

   ```typescript
   // Testable
   function calculateDiscount(cart): Discount {}

   // Hard to test
   function applyDiscount(cart): void {
     cart.total -= discount;
   }
   ```

3. **Small surface area.** Fewer methods = fewer tests needed. Fewer params = simpler test setup.

### Relationships

- A **Module** has exactly one **Interface** (the surface it presents to callers and tests).
- **Depth** is a property of a **Module**, measured against its **Interface**.
- A **Seam** is where a **Module**'s **Interface** lives.
- An **Adapter** sits at a **Seam** and satisfies the **Interface**.
- **Depth** produces **Leverage** for callers and **Locality** for maintainers.

### Rejected framings

- **Depth as ratio of implementation-lines to interface-lines** (Ousterhout): rewards padding the implementation. We use depth-as-leverage instead.
- **"Interface" as in the TypeScript `interface` keyword or a class's public methods**: too narrow: interface here includes every fact a caller must know.
- **"Boundary"**: overloaded with DDD's bounded context. Say **seam** or **interface**.

### Going deeper

- **Deepening a cluster given its dependencies**, see `~/.agents/references/deepening.md`: dependency categories, seam discipline, and replace-don't-layer testing.
- **Exploring alternative interfaces**, see `~/.agents/references/design-twice.md`: spin up parallel sub-agents to design the interface several radically different ways, then compare on depth, locality, and seam placement.

## Glossary

Use these terms exactly: don't substitute "component," "service," "API," or "boundary." Consistent language is the whole point.

**Module**: anything with an interface and an implementation. Deliberately scale-agnostic: a function, class, package, or tier-spanning slice. _Avoid_: unit, component, service.

**Interface**: everything a caller must know to use the module correctly: the type signature, but also invariants, ordering constraints, error modes, required configuration, and performance characteristics. _Avoid_: API, signature (too narrow, they refer only to the type-level surface).

**Implementation**: what's inside a module, its body of code. Distinct from **Adapter**: a thing can be a small adapter with a large implementation (a Postgres repo) or a large adapter with a small implementation (an in-memory fake). Reach for "adapter" when the seam is the topic; "implementation" otherwise.

**Depth**: leverage at the interface. The amount of behaviour a caller (or test) can exercise per unit of interface they have to learn. A module is **deep** when a large amount of behaviour sits behind a small interface, **shallow** when the interface is nearly as complex as the implementation.

**Seam** _(Michael Feathers)_: a place where you can alter behaviour without editing in that place; the *location* at which a module's interface lives. Where to put the seam is its own design decision, distinct from what goes behind it. _Avoid_: boundary (overloaded with DDD's bounded context).

**Adapter**: a concrete thing that satisfies an interface at a seam. Describes *role* (what slot it fills), not substance (what's inside).

**Leverage**: what callers get from depth. More capability per unit of interface they learn. One implementation pays back across N call sites and M tests.

**Locality**: what maintainers get from depth. Change, bugs, knowledge, and verification concentrate in one place rather than spreading across callers. Fix once, fixed everywhere.
